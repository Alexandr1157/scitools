This directory contains two executables:

  - pyreport: a modified version of pyreport where the graphics works
    with Easyviz, i.e., show() makes Easyviz display a plot in the
    report (the original version of pyreport was written by Gael
    Varoquaux, while Johannes H. Ring made the modifications for
    Easyviz).

  - scitools: a generic binary for all separate scripts from previous
    versions of SciTools (regression.py, subst.py, etc.). 
    Run scitools help or scitools --help to get a discription of what 
    this script can do.
