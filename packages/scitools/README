1. Introduction

SciTools is a Python package containing lots of useful tools for
scientific computing in Python. The package is built on top of other
widely used packages such as NumPy, SciPy, ScientificPython, Gnuplot,
etc. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Dependencies

SciTools only requirements are Python and some sort of Numerical Python
(NumPy, Numeric, or Numarray). For most users we recommend to use NumPy
(see http://numpy.org), however, it might be necessary in some cases to
install Numeric and/or Numarray as well since some older Python modules
may lack support for the new NumPy module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Installation

There are several different ways of installing SciTools:

 - Normal install ([, ... ] means optional)
  
     python setup.py install [,--prefix=$PREFIX]

 - Setuptools using eggs

   First build the egg with the following command	
    
     python setupegg.py [, egg_info --tag-svn-revision ] bdist_egg	

   Then install the created egg using easy_install

     easy_install [, --prefix=$PREFIX] dist/Scitools-0.1-py2.4.egg 

 - Manual

   Put the lib subdirectory in a directory contained in PYTHONPATH,
   and the bin subdirectory in a directory contained in PATH.
   (This gives access to the directories for scitools, easyviz, etc.)

 - Debian/Ubuntu packages

   If you have Debian or a Debian based platform like Ubuntu, there is a 
   repository with SciTools available at http://packages.simula.no (see
   http://packages.simula.no/README for how to enable this
   repository). With this repository enabled you should be able to 
   install SciTools simply by typing

     sudo apt-get install python-scitools

 - Extended

   Run build_scitools++.py. This makes a new directory build/scitools++
   that you can move to any convenient place. scitools++ contains
   scitools plus some standard Python modules like Gnuplot, IPython,
   epydoc, etc. Put scitools++/lib in PYTHONPATH and scitools++/bin in
   PATH. Or you may run scitools++/setup.py to install scitools++ in the
   official installation directories on your system.
