There are two ways of using scitools:

1. Put the lib subdirectory here in PYTHONPATH and bin in PATH.
This gives access to the svn directories for scitools, easyviz, etc.

2. Run build_scitools++.py. This makes a new directory build/scitools++
that you can move to any convenient place. scitools++ contains scitools
plus some standard Python modules like Gnuplot, IPython, epydoc, etc.
Put scitools++/lib in PYTHONPATH and scitools++/bin in PATH.
Or you may run scitools++/setup.py to install scitools++ in the
official installation directories on your system.
