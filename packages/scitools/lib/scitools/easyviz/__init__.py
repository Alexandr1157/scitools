Easyviz
=======

Easyviz is a unified interface to various packages for scientific
visualization and plotting.  The Easyviz interface is written in
Python with the purpose of making it very easy to visualize data in
Python scripts. Both curve plots and more advanced 2D/3D visualization
of scalar and vector fields are supported.  The Easyviz interface was
designed with three ideas in mind: 1) a simple, Matlab-like syntax; 2)
a unified interface to lots of visualization engines (called backends
later): Gnuplot, VTK, Matlab, Matplotlib, PyX, etc.; and 3) a
minimalistic interface which offers only basic control of plots
(fine-tuning is left to programming in the specific backend directly).

Guiding Principles
------------------

*First principle.* Array data can be plotted with a minimal
set of keystrokes using a Matlab-like syntax. A simple::

        t = linspace(0, 3, 51)    # 51 points between 0 and 3
        y = t**2*exp(-t**2)
        plot(t, y) 

plots the data in (the NumPy array) t versus the data in (the NumPy
array) y. If you need legends, control of the axis, as well as
additional curves, all this is obtained by the standard Matlab-style
commands::

        y2 = t**4*exp(-t**2)
        # pick out each 4 points and add random noise:
        t3 = t[::4]
        random.seed(11)
        y3 = y2[::4] + random.normal(loc=0, scale=0.02, size=len(t3))
        
        plot(t, y1, 'r-')
        hold('on')
        plot(t, y2, 'b-')
        plot(t3, y3, 'bo')
        legend('t^2*exp(-t^2)', 't^4*exp(-t^2)', 'data')
        title('Simple Plot Demo')
        axis([0, 3, -0.05, 0.6])
        xlabel('t')
        ylabel('y')
        show()
        
        hardcopy('tmp0.ps')  # this one can be included in latex
        hardcopy('tmp0.png') # this one can be included in HTML

Easyviz also allows these additional function calls to be executed
as a part of the plot call::

        plot(t, y1, 'r-', t, y2, 'b-', t3, y3, 'bo',
             legend=('t^2*exp(-t^2)', 't^4*exp(-t^2)', 'data'),
             title='Simple Plot Demo',
             axis=(0, 3, -0.05, 0.6),
             xlabel='t', ylabel='y',
             hardcopy='tmp1.ps',
             show=True)
        
        hardcopy('tmp0.png') # this one can be included in HTML

A scalar function f(x,y) may be visualized
as an elevated surface with colors using these commands::

        x = seq(-2, 2, 0.1)      # -2 to 2 with steps of 0.1
        xv, yv = meshgrid(x, x)  # define a 2D grid with points (xv,yv)
        values = f(xv, yv)       # function values
        surfc(xv, yv, values,
              shading='interp',
              clevels=15,
              clabels='on',
              hidden='on',
              show=True)


*Second princple.* Easyviz is just a unified interface to other plotting
packages that can be called from Python. Such plotting packages are
referred to as backends. Several backends are supported: Gnuplot,
Matplotlib, Pmw.Blt.Graph, PyX, Matlab, VTK. In other words, scripts
that use Easyviz commands only, can work with a variety of backends,
depending on what you have installed on the machine in question and
what quality of the plots you demand. For example, switching from
Gnuplot to Matplotlib is trivial.

Scripts with Easyviz commands will most probably run anywhere since at
least the Gnuplot package can always be installed right away on any
platform. In practice this means that when you write a script to
automate investigation of a scientific problem, you can always quickly
plot your data with Easyviz (i.e., Matlab-like) commands and postpone
to marry any specific plotting tool. Most likely, the choice of
plotting backend can remain flexible. This will also allow old scripts
to work with new fancy plotting packages in the future if Easyviz
backends are written for those packages.

*Third principle.* The Easyviz interface is minimalistic, aimed at
rapid prototyping of plots. This makes the Easyviz code easy to read
and extend (e.g., with new backends). If you need more sophisticated
plotting, like controlling tickmarks, inserting annotations, etc., you
must grab the backend object and use the backend-specific syntax to
fine-tune the plot. The idea is that you can get away with Easyviz
and a plotting package-independent script "95 percent" of the time - only now
and then there will be demand for package-dependent code for
fine-tuning and customization of figures.

These three principles and the Easyviz implementation make simple things
simple and unified, and complicated things are not more complicated than
they would otherwise be. You can always start out with the simple
commands - and jump to complicated fine-tuning only when strictly needed.

Controlling the Backend
-----------------------

The Easyviz backend can either be set in a config file (see Config File
below) or by a command-line option::

         --SCITOOLS_easyviz_backend name

where name is the name of the backend: gnuplot, vtk, matplotlib,
blt. Which backend you
choose depends on what you have available on your computer system and
what kind of plotting functionality you want.


Config File
-----------

Easyviz is a subpackage of SciTools, and the the SciTools configuration
file, called scitools.cfg has a section [easyviz] where the
backend in Easyviz can be set::

        [easyviz]
        backend = vtk

A scitools.cfg can be placed in the current working folder, thereby
affecting plots made in this folder, or it can be located in the
user's home folder, which will affect all plotting sessions for the
user in question.


Tutorial
========

This tutorial starts with plotting a single curve with a simple
plot(x,y) command. Then we add a legend, axis labels, a title, etc.
Thereafter we show how multiple curves are plotted together. We also
explain how line styles and axis range can be controlled. The
next section deals with animations and making movie files. More advanced
topics such as fine tuning of plots (using plotting package-specific
commands) and working with Axis and Figure objects close the curve
plotting part of the tutorial.

Various methods for visualization of scalar fields in 2D and 3D are
treated next, before we show how 2D and 3D vector fields can be handled.


Plotting a Single Curve
-----------------------


Let us plot the curve y = t^2\exp(-t^2) for t values between 0 and 3.
First we generate equally spaced coordinates for t, say 51 values (50
intervals). Then we compute the corresponding y values at these
points, before we call the plot(t,y) command to make the curve plot.
Here is the complete program::

        from scitools.all import *
        
        def f(t):
            return t**2*exp(-t**2)
        
        t = linspace(0, 3, 51)    # 51 points between 0 and 3
        y = zeros(len(t), float)  # allocate y with float elements
        for i in xrange(len(t)):
            y[i] = f(t[i])
        
        plot(t, y)

The first line imports all of SciTools and Easyviz that can be handy
to have when doing scientific computations. In this program we
pre-allocate the y array and fill it with values, element by
element, in a (slow) Python loop. Alternatively, we may operate
on the whole t array at once, which yields faster and shorter code::

        from scitools.all import *
        
        def f(t):
            return t**2*exp(-t**2)
        
        t = linspace(0, 3, 51)    # 51 points between 0 and 3
        y = f(t)                  # compute all f values at once
        plot(t, y)

The f function can also be skipped, if desired, so that we can write
directly::

        y = t**2*exp(-t**2)


To include the plot in electronic documents, we need a hardcopy of the
figure in PostScript, PNG, or another image format.  The hardcopy
command produces files with images in various formats::

        hardcopy('tmp1.eps') # produce PostScript
        hardcopy('tmp1.png') # produce PNG

The filename extension determines the format: .ps or
.eps for PostScript, and .png for PNG. 
Figure fig:plot1a displays the resulting plot.

FIGURE:[figs/plot1a.eps] A simple plot in PostScript format.


Decorating the Plot
-------------------

The x and y axis in curve plots should have labels, here t and
y, respectively. Also, the curve should be identified with a label,
or legend as it is often called.  A title above the plot is also
common.  All such things are easily added after the plot command::

        xlabel('t')
        ylabel('y')
        legend('t^2*exp(-t^2)')
        axis([0, 3, -0.05, 0.6])   # t in [0,3], y in [-0.05,0.6]
        title('My First Easyviz Demo')

This syntax is inspired by Matlab to make the switch between
Easyviz and Matlab almost trivial.
Easyviz has also introduced a more "Pythonic" plot command where
all the plot properties can be set at once::

        plot(t, y,
             xlabel='t',
             ylabel='y',
             legend='t^2*exp(-t^2)',
             axis=[0, 3, -0.05, 0.6],
             title='My First Easyviz Demo',
             hardcopy='tmp1.eps',
             show=True)


With show=False one can avoid the plot window on the screen and
just make the hardcopy. This feature is particularly useful if
you generate a large number of plots in a loop.

Note that we in the curve legend write t square as t^2 (LaTeX style)
rather than t**2 (program style). Whichever form you choose is up to
you, but the LaTeX form sometimes looks better in some plotting
programs (Gnuplot is one example). 
See Figure fig:plot1c for how the modified
plot looks like and how t^2 is typeset in Gnuplot.


FIGURE:[figs/plot1c.eps] A single curve with label, title, and axis adjusted.


Plotting Multiple Curves
------------------------

A common plotting task is to compare two or more curves, which
requires multiple curves to be drawn in the same plot.
Suppose we want to plot the two functions f_1(t)=t^2\exp(-t^2)
and f_2(t)=t^4\exp(-t^2). If we issue two plot commands after
each other, two separate plots will be made. To make the second
plot command draw the curve in the first plot, we need to
issue a hold('on') command. Alternatively, we can provide all
data in a single plot command. A complete program illustrates the
different approaches::

        from scitools.all import *   # for curve plotting
        
        def f1(t):
            return t**2*exp(-t**2)
        
        def f2(t):
            return t**2*f1(t)
        
        t = linspace(0, 3, 51)
        y1 = f1(t)
        y2 = f2(t)
        
        # Matlab-style syntax:
        plot(t, y1)
        hold('on')
        plot(t, y2)
        
        xlabel('t')
        ylabel('y')
        legend('t^2*exp(-t^2)', 't^4*exp(-t^2)')
        title('Plotting two curves in the same plot')
        hardcopy('tmp2.eps')
        
        # alternative:
        plot(t, y1, t, y2, xlabel='t', ylabel='y',
             legend=('t^2*exp(-t^2)', 't^4*exp(-t^2)'),
             title='Plotting two curves in the same plot',
             hardcopy='tmp2.eps')

The sequence of the multiple legends is such that the first legend 
corresponds to the first curve, the second legend to the second curve,
and so on. The visual result appears in Figure fig:plot2a.

Doing a hold('off') makes the next plot command create a new
plot.

FIGURE:[figs/plot2a.eps] Two curves in the same plot.



Controlling Axis and Line Styles
--------------------------------

A plotting program will normally compute sensible ranges of
the axis. For example, the Gnuplot program has in our examples
so far used an y axis from 0 to 0.6 while the x axis goes from
0 to 3. Sometimes it is desired to adjust the range
of the axis. Say we want the x axis to go from 0 to 4 (although the
data stops at x=3), while y axis goes from -0.1 to 0.6.
In the Matlab-like syntax new axis specifications are 
done by the axis command::

        axis([0, 4, -0.1, 0.6])

With a single plot command we must use the axis keyword::

        plot(t, y1, t, y2, ...
             axis=[0, 4, -0.1, 0.6],
             ...)

In both cases, the axis specification is a list of the
x_{\rm min}, x_{\rm max}, y_{\rm min}, and y_{\rm max}
values.

The two curves get distinct default line styles, depending on the
program that is used to produce the curve (and the settings for this
program). It might well happen that you get a green and a red curve
(which is bad for a significant portion of the male population).  We
may therefore often want to control the line style in detail. Say we
want the first curve (t and y1) to be drawn as a red solid line
and the second curve (t and y2) as blue circles at the discrete
data points.  The Matlab-inspired syntax for specifying line types
applies a letter for the color and a symbol from the keyboard for the
line type. For example, r- represents a red (r) line (-), while
bo means blue (b) circles (o). The line style specification is
added as an argument after the x and y coordinate arrays of the
curve::

        plot(t, y1, 'r-')
        hold('on')
        plot(t, y2, 'bo')
        
        # or
        plot(t, y1, 'r-', t, y2, 'bo')

The effect of controlling the line styles can be seen in 
Figure fig:plot2c.

FIGURE:[figs/plot2c.eps] Two curves in the same plot, with controlled line styles.

Assume now that we want to plot the blue circles at every 4 points only.
We can grab every 4 points out of the t array by using an appropriate
slice: t2 = t[::4]. Note that the first colon means the range from the
first to the last data point, while the second colon separates this
range from the stride, i.e., how many points we should "jump over"
when we pick out a set of values of the array.

In this plot we also adjust the size of the line and the circles by
adding an integer: r-6 means a red line with thickness 6 and bo5
means red circles with size 5. The effect of the given line thickness
and symbol size depends on the underlying plotting program. For
the Gnuplot program one can view the effect in Figure fig:plot2g::

        from scitools.all import *
        
        def f1(t):
            return t**2*exp(-t**2)
        
        def f2(t):
            return t**2*f1(t)
        
        t = linspace(0, 3, 51)
        y1 = f1(t)
        t2 = t[::4]
        y2 = f2(t2)
        
        plot(t, y1, 'r-6', t2, y2, 'bo3',
             xlabel='t', ylabel='y',
             axis=[0, 4, -0.1, 0.6],
             legend=('t^2*exp(-t^2)', 't^4*exp(-t^2)'),
             title='Plotting two curves in the same plot',
             hardcopy='tmp2.eps')


FIGURE:[figs/plot2g.eps] Circles at every 4 points and extended line thickness (6) and circle size (3).


The different available line colors include 
  * yellow:   'y'
  * magenta:  'm'
  * cyan:     'c'
  * red:      'r'
  * green:    'g'
  * blue:     'b'
  * white:    'w'
  * black:    'k'

The different available line types are
  * solid line:      '-'
  * dashed line:     '--'
  * dotted line:     ':'
  * dash-dot line:   '-.'

During programming, you can find all these details in the
documentation of the plot function. Just type help(plot)
in an interactive Python shell or invoke pydoc with
scitools.easyviz.plot. This tutorial is available
through pydoc scitools.easyviz.

We remark that in the Gnuplot program all the different line types are
drawn as solid lines on the screen. The hardcopy chooses automatically
different line types (solid, dashed, etc.) and not in accordance with
the line type specification.

Lots of markers at data points are available:
  * plus sign:                     '+'
  * circle:                        'o'
  * asterisk:                      '*'
  * point:                         '.'
  * cross:                         'x'
  * square:                        's'
  * diamond:                       'd'
  * upward-pointing triangle:      '^'
  * downward-pointing triangle:    'v'
  * right-pointing triangle:       '>'
  * left-pointing triangle:        '<'
  * five-point star (pentagram):   'p'
  * six-point star (hexagram):     'h'
  * no marker (default): None

Symbols and line styles may be combined, for instance as in 'kx-',
which means a black solid line with black crosses at the data points.


*Another Example.* Let us extend the previous example with a third
curve where the data points are slightly randomly distributed around
the f_2(t) curve::

        from scitools.all import *
        
        def f1(t):
            return t**2*exp(-t**2)
        
        def f2(t):
            return t**2*f1(t)
        
        t = linspace(0, 3, 51)
        y1 = f1(t)
        y2 = f2(t)
        
        # pick out each 4 points and add random noise:
        t3 = t[::4]      # slice, stride 4
        random.seed(11)  # fix random sequence
        noise = random.normal(loc=0, scale=0.02, size=len(t3))
        y3 = y2[::4] + noise
        
        plot(t, y1, 'r-')
        hold('on')
        plot(t, y2, 'ks-')   # black solid line with squares at data points
        plot(t3, y3, 'bo')
        
        legend('t^2*exp(-t^2)', 't^4*exp(-t^2)', 'data')
        title('Simple Plot Demo')
        axis([0, 3, -0.05, 0.6])
        xlabel('t')
        ylabel('y')
        show()
        hardcopy('tmp3.eps') 
        hardcopy('tmp3.png')

The plot is shown in Figure fig:plot3.

FIGURE:[figs/plot3.eps] A plot with three curves.

*Minimalistic Typing.* When exploring mathematics in the interactive Python shell, most of us
are interested in the quickest possible commands.
Here is an example on minimalistic syntax for
comparing the two sample functions we have used in the previous examples::

        t = linspace(0, 3, 51)
        plot(t, t**2*exp(-t**2), t, t**4*exp(-t**2))



Interactive Plotting Sessions
-----------------------------

All the Easyviz commands can of course be issued in an interactive
Python session. The only thing to comment is that the plot command
returns a result::

        >>> t = linspace(0, 3, 51)
        >>> plot(t, t**2*exp(-t**2))
        [<scitools.easyviz.common.Line object at 0xb5727f6c>]

Most users will just ignore this output line.

All Easyviz commands that produce a plot return an object reflecting the
particular type of plot. The plot command returns a list of
Line objects, one for each curve in the plot. These Line
objects can be invoked to see, for instance, the value of different
parameters in the plot::

        >>> line, = plot(x, y, 'b')
        >>> getp(line)
        {'description': '',
         'dims': (4, 1, 1),
         'legend': '',
         'linecolor': 'b',
         'pointsize': 1.0,
         ...

Such output is mostly of interest to advanced users.


Making Animations
-----------------

A sequence of plots can be combined into an animation and stored in a
movie file. First we need to generate a series of hardcopies, i.e.,
plots stored in files. Thereafter we must use a tool to combine the
individual plot files into a movie file. We shall illustrate the
process with an example.

The function
f(x; m,s) = 1/(sqrt(2*pi)*s)*exp(-0.5*((x-m)/s)**2),
known as the "Gaussian bell function",
is a "wide" function for large s and "peak-formed" for small s,
see Figure fig:plot4. The function is symmetric around x=m
(m=0 in the figure).
Our goal is to make an animation where we see how this function evolves
as s is decreased. In Python we implement the formula above as
a function f(x, m, s). 

FIGURE:[figs/plot4.eps] Different shapes of a Gaussian bell function.

The animation is created by varying s in a loop and for each s
issue a plot command. A moving curve is then visible on the screen.
One can also make a movie file that can be played as any other
computer movie using a standard movie player. To this end, each plot
is saved to a file, and all the files are combined together using some
suitable tool, which is reached through the movie function in
Easyviz. All necessary steps will be apparent in the complete program
below, but before diving into the code we need to comment upon a
couple of issues with setting up the plot command for animations.

The underlying plotting program will normally adjust the axis to the
maximum and minimum values of the curve if we do not specify the axis
ranges explicitly. For an animation such automatic axis adjustment is
misleading - the axis ranges must be fixed to avoid a jumping
axis. The relevant values for the axis range is the minimum and
maximum value of f. The minimum value is zero, while the maximum
value appears for x=m and increases with decreasing s. The range
of the y axis must therefore be [0,f(m; m, \min s)].

The function f is defined for all -\infty < x < \infty, but the
function value is very small already 3s away from x=m. We may therefore
limit the x coordinates to [m-3s,m+3s].

Now we are ready to take a look at the complete code
for animating how the Gaussian bell curve evolves as the s parameter
is decreased from 2 to 0.2::

        from scitools.all import *
        import time
        
        def f(x, m, s):
            return (1.0/(sqrt(2*pi)*s))*exp(-0.5*((x-m)/s)**2)
        
        m = 0
        s_start = 2
        s_stop = 0.2
        s_values = linspace(s_start, s_stop, 30)
        x = linspace(m -3*s_start, m + 3*s_start, 1000)
        # f is max for x=m; smaller s gives larger max value
        max_f = f(m, m, s_stop)
        
        # show the movie, and make hardcopies of frames simultaneously:
        counter = 0
        for s in s_values:
            y = f(x, m, s)
            plot(x, y, axis=[x[0], x[-1], -0.1, max_f],
                 xlabel='x', ylabel='f', legend='s=%4.2f' % s,
                 hardcopy='tmp_%04d.eps' % counter)
            counter += 1
            #time.sleep(0.2)  # can insert a pause to control movie speed
        
        # make movie file the simplest possible way:
        movie('tmp_*.eps')


First note that the s values are decreasing (linspace handles this
automatically if the start value is greater than the stop value).
Also note that we, simply because we think it is visually more
attractive, let the y axis go from -0.1 although the f function is
always greater than zero.

For each frame (plot) in the movie we store the plot in a file.  The
different files need different names and an easy way of referring to
the set of files in right order. We therefore suggest to use filenames
of the form stem0001.ext, stem0002.ext, stem0003.ext, etc.,
since an alphabetic sort of the filenames then gives the right
sequence of the files (and so does the expression stem*.ext used
in the operating system or in Python's fnmatch or glob modules).
In our example, stem is tmp_, and .ext is .eps
(which implies the PostScript format in the hardcopy).
The printf format 04d pads the integers with zeros such that
1 becomes 0001, 13 becomes 0013 and so on.

Having a set of stem*.ext files, one can simply generate a movie by
a movie('stem*.ext') call. The movie function generates a movie
file called movie.avi (AVI format), movie.mpeg (MPEG format), or
movie.gif (animated GIF format) in the current working
directory. The movie format depends on the encoders found on your
machine.

You can get complete control of the movie format and the
name of the movie file by supplying more arguments to the
movie function. First, let us generate an animated GIF
file called tmpmovie.gif::

        movie('tmp_*.eps', encoder='convert', fps=2,
              output_file='tmpmovie.gif')

The generation of animated GIF images applies the convert program
from the ImageMagick suite. This program must of course be installed
on the machine. The argument fps stands for frames per second so
here the speed of the movie is slow in that there is a delay of half
a second between each frame (image file).
To view the animated GIF file, one can use the animate
program (also from ImageMagick) and give the movie file as command-line
argument. One can alternatively put the GIF file in a web page 
in an IMG tag such that a browser automatically displays the movie.

An MPEG movie can be generated by the call::

        movie('tmp_*.eps', encoder='ffmpeg', fps=4,
              output_file='tmpmovie1.mpeg',

Alternatively, we may use the ppmtompeg encoder from the Netpbm suite of
image manipulation tools::

        movie('tmp_*.eps', encoder='ppmtompeg', fps=24,
              output_file='tmpmovie2.mpeg',

The ppmtompeg supports only a few (high) frame rates.

The next sample call to movie uses the Mencoder tool and specifies 
some additional arguments (video codec, video bitrate, and the 
quantization scale)::

        movie('tmp_*.eps', encoder='mencoder', fps=24,
              output_file='tmpmovie.mpeg',
              vcodec='mpeg2video', vbitrate=2400, qscale=4)




Advanced Easyviz Topics
-----------------------

The information in the previous sections aims at being sufficient for
the daily work with plotting curves. Sometimes, however, one wants
to fine-control the plot or how Easyviz behaves. First, we explain
how to speed up the from scitools.all import * statement. 
Second, we show how to operate with the plotting program directly and
using plotting program-specific advanced features. Third, we explain
how the user can grab Figure and Axis objects that Easyviz
produces "behind the curtain".

*Importing Just Easyviz.* The from scitools.all import * statement imports many modules and packages:
  * from scitools.easyviz import *
  * from numpy import *
  * from scipy import * (if scipy is available)
  * the Python modules sys, os, math, operator, pprint
  * from numpyutils import * (SciTools module)
  * the SciTools module StringFunction and the SciTools 
    functions watch and trace for debugging

The scipy import can take some time and lead to slow start-up of plot 
scripts. A more minimalistic import for curve plotting is 
!bc  
        from scitools.easyviz import *
        from numpy import *

Alternatively, one can edit the scitools.cfg configure file or add
one's own .scitools.cfg file with redefinition of selected options,
such as load in the scipy section. The user .scitools.cfg must 
be placed in the folder where the plotting script in action resides, 
or in the user's home folder. Instead of editing a configuration
file, one can just add the command-line argument --SCITOOLS_scipy_load no
to the curve plotting script (all sections/options in the configuration
file can also be set by such command-line arguments).


*Working with the Plotting Program Directly.* Easyviz supports just the most common plotting commands, typically the
commands you use "95 percent" of the time when exploring curves.
Various plotting packages have lots of additional commands for
different advanced features.  When Easyviz does not have a command
that supports a particular feature, one can grab the Python object
that communicates with the underlying plotting program (known as
"backend") and work with
this object directly, using plotting program-specific command
syntax.  Let us illustrate this principle with an example where we add
a text and an arrow in the plot, see Figure fig:plot2i.

FIGURE:[figs/plot2i.eps] Illustration of a text and an arrow using Gnuplot-specific commands.

Easyviz does not support text and arrows at arbitrary places inside
the plot, but Gnuplot does. If we use Gnuplot as backend, we may grab
the Gnuplot object and issue Gnuplot commands to
this object directly. Here is an example on the typical recipe::

        g = get_backend()
        if g.__class__.__name__ == 'Gnuplot':
            # g is a Gnuplot object, work with Gnuplot commands directly:
            g('set label "global maximum" at 0.1,0.5 font "Times,18"')
            g('set arrow from 0.5,0.48 to 0.98,0.37 linewidth 2')
        g.refresh()
        g.hardcopy('tmp2.eps')  # make new hardcopy

We refer to the Gnuplot manual for the features of this package and
the syntax of the commands. The idea is that you can quickly generate
plots with Easyviz using standard commands that are independent of
the underlying plotting package. However, when you need advanced
features, you must add plotting package-specific code as shown
above. This principle makes Easyviz a light-weight interface, but
without limiting the available functionality of various plotting programs.


*Working with Axis and Figure Objects.* Easyviz supports the concept of Axis objects, as in Matlab.
The Axis object represents a set of axes, with curves drawn in the
associated coordinate system. A figure is the complete physical plot.
One may have several axes in one figure, each axis representing a subplot.
One may also have several figures, represented by different
windows on the screen or separate hardcopies.

Users with Matlab experience may prefer to set axis
labels, ranges, and the title using an Axis object instead of
providing the information in separate commands or as part of a plot
command. The gca (get current axis) command returns an Axis
object, whose set method can be used to set axis properties::

        plot(t, y1, 'r-', t, y2, 'bo',
             legend=('t^2*exp(-t^2)', 't^4*exp(-t^2)'),
             hardcopy='tmp2.eps')
        
        ax = gca()   # get current Axis object
        ax.setp(xlabel='t', ylabel='y',
                axis=[0, 4, -0.1, 0.6],
                title='Plotting two curves in the same plot')
        show()  # show the plot again after ax.setp actions


The figure() call makes a new figure, i.e., a
new window with curve plots. Figures are numbered as 1, 2, and so on.
The command figure(3) sets the current figure object to figure number
3. 

Suppose we want to plot our y1 and y2 data in two separate windows.
We need in this case to work with two Figure objects::

        plot(t, y1, 'r-', xlabel='t', ylabel='y',
             axis=[0, 4, -0.1, 0.6])
        
        figure()  # new figure
        
        plot(t, y2, 'bo', xlabel='t', ylabel='y')

We may now go back to the first figure (with the y1 data) and
set a title and legends in this plot, show the plot, and make a PostScript
version of the plot::

        figure(1)  # go back to first figure
        title('One curve')
        legend('t^2*exp(-t^2)')
        show()
        hardcopy('tmp2_1.eps')

We can also adjust figure 2::

        figure(2)  # go to second figure
        title('Another curve')
        hardcopy('tmp2_2.eps')
        show()

The current Figure object is reached by gcf (get current figure),
and the dump method dumps the internal parameters in the Figure
object::

        fig = gcf(); print fig.dump()

These parameters may be of interest for troubleshooting when Easyviz
does not produce what you expect.

Let us then make a third figure with two plots, or more precisely, two
axes: one with y1 data and one with y2 data.
Easyviz has a command subplot(r,c,a) for creating r
rows and c columns and set the current axis to axis number a.
In the present case subplot(2,1,1) sets the current axis to
the first set of axis in a "table" with two rows and one column.
Here is the code for this third figure::

        figure()  # new, third figure
        # plot y1 and y2 as two axis in the same figure:
        subplot(2, 1, 1)
        plot(t, y1, xlabel='t', ylabel='y')
        subplot(2, 1, 2)
        plot(t, y2, xlabel='t', ylabel='y')
        title('A figure with two plots')
        show()
        hardcopy('tmp2_3.eps')


If we need to place an axis at an arbitrary position in the figure, we
must use the command::

        ax = axes(viewport=[left, bottom, width, height])

The four parameteres left, bottom, width, height
are location values between 0 and 1 ((0,0) is the lower-left corner 
and (1,1) is the upper-right corner).


Visualization of Scalar Fields
------------------------------

A scalar field is a function from space or space-time to a real value.
This real value typically reflects a scalar physical parameter at every
point in space (or in space and time). One example is temperature,
which is a scalar quantity defined everywhere in space and time.  In a
visualization context, we work with discrete scalar fields that are
defined on a grid. Each point in the grid is then associated with a
scalar value.

There are several ways to visualize a scalar field in Easyviz. Both
two- and three-dimensional scalar fields are supported. In 2D we can
create elevated surface plots, contour plots, and pseudocolor plots,
while in 3D we can create isosurface plots, volumetric slice plots,
and contour slice plots.

Elevated Surface Plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create elevated surface plots we can use either the surf or the
mesh command. Both commands have the same syntax, but the mesh
command creates a wireframe mesh while the surf command creates a
solid colored surface. 

Our examples will make use of the scalar field
f(x,y)=sin(r), 
where r is the distance in the plane from the origin, i.e.,
r=sqrt(x**2+y**2).
The x and y values in our 2D domain lie between -5 and 5.

The example first creates the necessary data arrays for 2D scalar
field plotting: the coordinates in each direction, extensions of these
arrays to form a *meshgrid*, and the function values. The latter array
is computed in a vectorized operation which requires the extended
coordinate arrays from the meshgrid function.  The mesh command
can then produce the plot with a syntax that mirrors the simplicity of
the plot command for curves::

        x = y = linspace(-5, 5, 21)
        xv, yv = meshgrid(x, y)
        values = sin(sqrt(xv**2 + yv**2))
        h = mesh(xv, yv, values)

The mesh command returns a reference to a new Surface object, here
stored in a variable h. This reference can be used to set or get
properties in the object at a later stage if needed.  The resulting
plot can be seen in Figure fig:mesh_ex1.

FIGURE:[figs/mesh_ex1.eps] Result of the mesh command for plotting a 2D scalar field (Gnuplot backend).

The surf command employs the same syntax, but results in a different
plot (see Figure fig:surf_ex1)::

        surf(xv, yv, values)


FIGURE:[figs/surf_ex1.eps] Result of the surf command (Gnuplot backend).

The surf command offers many possibilities to adjust the resulting plot::

        set(interactive=False)
        surf(xv, yv, values)
        shading('flat')
        colorbar()
        colormap(hot())
        axis([-6,6,-6,6,-1.5,1.5])
        view(35,45)
        show()

Here we have specified a flat shading model, added a color bar, changed
the color map to hot, set some suitable axis values, and changed the
view point. The same plot can also be accomplished with one single, compound
statement (as Easyviz offers for the plot command)::

        surf(xv, yv, values,
             shading='interp',
             colorbar='on',
             colormap=jet(),
             axis=[-6,6,-6,6,-1.5,1.5],
             view=[-35,35])

Figure fig:surf_ex2 displays the result.

FIGURE:[figs/surf_ex2.eps] Result of an extended surf command (Gnuplot backend).


Contour Plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A contour plot is another useful technique for visualizing scalar
fields. The primary examples on contour plots from everyday life is
the level curves on geographical maps, reflecting the height of the
terrain. Mathematically, a contour line, also called isoline, is
defined as the implicit curve f(x,y)=c. The contour levels c are
normally uniformly distributed between the extreme values of the
function f (this is the case in a map: the height difference between
two contour lines is constant), but in scientific visualization it is
sometimes useful to use a few carefully selected c values to
illustrate particular features of a scalar field.

In Easyviz, there are several commands for creating different kinds of
contour plots:

  * contour: Draw a standard contour plot, i.e., lines in the plane.

  * contourf: Draw a filled 2D contour plot, where the space between
    the contour lines is filled with colors.

  * contour3: Same as contour, but the curves are drawn at their 
    corresponding height levels in 3D space.

  * meshc: Works in the same way as mesh except that a
     contour plot is drawn in the plane beneath the mesh. 

  * surfc: Same as meshc except that a solid surface is
    drawn instead of a wireframe mesh.

We start with illustrating the plain contour command, assuming that
we already have computed the xv, yv, and values
arrays as shown in our first example on scalar field plotting.
The basic syntax follows mesh and surf::

        contour(xv, yv, values)

By default, five uniformly spaced contour level curves are drawn, see
Figure fig:contour_ex1. 

FIGURE:[figs/contour_ex1.eps] Result of the simplest possible contour command (Gnuplot backend).

The number of levels in a contour plot can be specified with an additional
argument::

        n = 15   # number of desired contour levels
        contour(xv, yv, values, n)

The result can be seen in Figure fig:contour_ex2. 

FIGURE:[figs/contour_ex2.eps] A contour plot with 15 contour levels (Gnuplot backend).

Sometimes one wants contour levels that are not equidistant or not
distributed throughout the range of the scalar field. Individual
contour levels to be drawn can easily be specified as a list::

        levels = [-0.5, 0.1, 0.3, 0.9]
        contour(xv, yv, values, levels, clabels='on')

Now, the levels list specify the values of the contour levels, and
the clabel keyword allows labeling of the level values in the plot.
Figure fig:contour_ex3 shows the result. We remark that the
Gnuplot backend colors the contour lines and places the contour values
and corresponding colors beside the plot. Figures that are reproduced
in black and white only can then be hard to analyze. Other backends
may draw the contour lines in black and annotate each line with the
corresponding contour level value.  Such plots are better suited for
being displayed in black and white.

FIGURE:[figs/contour_ex3.eps] Four individually specified contour levels (Gnuplot backend).

The contourf command,
!bc  
        contourf(xv, yv, values)

gives a filled contour plot as shown in Figure fig:contourf_ex1.
Only the Matplotlib and VTK backends currently supports filled
contour plots. 

FIGURE:[figs/contourf_ex1.eps] Filled contour plot created by the contourf command (VTK backend).

The contour lines can be "lifted up" in 3D space, as shown in Figure
fig:contour3_ex1, using the contour3 command::

        contour3(xv, yv, values, 15)


FIGURE:[figs/contour3_ex1.eps] Example on the contour3 command for elevated contour levels (Gnuplot backend).

Finally, we show a simple example illustrating the meshc and surfc
commands::

        meshc(xv, yv, values, 
              clevels=10, 
              colormap=hot(), 
              grid='off')
        figure()
        surfc(xv, yv, values, 
              clevels=15, 
              colormap=hsv(), 
              grid='off',
              view=(30,40))

The resulting plots are displayed in Figures fig:meshc_ex1 and
fig:surfc_ex1.

FIGURE:[figs/meshc_ex1.eps] Wireframe mesh with contours at the bottom (Gnuplot backend).

FIGURE:[figs/surfc_ex1.eps] Surface plot with contours (Gnuplot backend).


Pseudocolor Plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another way of visualizing a 2D scalar field in Easyviz is the
pcolor command. This command creates a pseudocolor plot, which is a
flat surface viewed from above. The simplest form of this command
follows the syntax of the other commands::

        pcolor(xv, yv, values)

We can set the color shading in a pseudocolor plot either by giving
the shading keyword argument to pcolor or by calling the shading
command. The color shading is specified by a string that can be either
'faceted' (default), 'flat', or 'interp' (interpolated). The Gnuplot and
Matplotlib backends support 'faceted' and 'flat' only, while the
VTK backend supports all of them.

FIGURE:[figs/pcolor_ex1.eps] Pseudocolor plot (Gnuplot backend).


Isosurface Plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For 3D scalar fields, isosurfaces or contour surfaces constitute the counterpart to contour
lines or isolines for 2D scalar fields. An isosurface connects points in
a scalar field with (approximately) the same scalar value and is
mathematically defined by the implicit equation f(x,y,z)=c. In Easyviz,
isosurfaces are created with the isosurface command. We will
demonstrate this command using 3D scalar field data from the flow
function. This function, also found in Matlab,
generates fluid flow data. Our first isosurface visualization example
then looks as follows::

        x, y, z, v = flow()  # generate fluid-flow data
        set(show=False)
        h = isosurface(x,y,z,v,-3)
        h.set(opacity=0.5)
        shading('interp')
        daspect([1,1,1])
        view(3)
        axis('tight')
        set(show=True)
        show()

After creating some scalar volume data with the flow function, we
create an isosurface with the isovalue -3. The isosurface is then
set a bit transparent (opacity=0.5) before we specify the shading
model and the view point. We also set the data aspect ratio to be
equal in all directions with the daspect command.  The resulting
plot is shown in Figure fig:isosurface1. We remark that the
Gnuplot backend does not support 3D scalar fields and hence not
isosurfaces.

FIGURE:[figs/isosurface1.eps] Isosurface plot (VTK backend).

Here is another example that demonstrates the isosurface command
(again using the flow function)::

        x, y, z, v = flow()
        set(show=False)
        h = isosurface(x,y,z,v,0)
        shading('interp')
        daspect([1,4,4])
        view([-65,20])
        axis('tight')
        set(show=True)
        show()

Figure fig:isosurface2 shows the resulting plot.

FIGURE:[figs/isosurface2.eps] Another isosurface plot (VTK backend).


Volumetric Slice Plot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another way of visualizing scalar volume data is by using the slice_
command (since the name slice is already taken by a built-in
function in Python for array slicing, we have followed the standard
Python convention and added a trailing underscore to the name in
Easyviz - slice_ is thus the counterpart to the Matlab function
slice.). This command draws orthogonal slice planes through a
given volumetric data set. Here is an example on how to use the
slice_ command::

        x, y, z = meshgrid(seq(-2,2,.2), seq(-2,2,.25), seq(-2,2,.16),
                           sparse=True)
        v = x*exp(-x**2 - y**2 - z**2)
        xslice = [-1.2, .8, 2]
        yslice = 2
        zslice = [-2, 0]
        slice_(x, y, z, v, xslice, yslice, zslice,
               colormap=hsv(), grid='off')

Note that we here use the SciTools function seq for specifying a
uniform partitioning of an interval - the linspace function from
numpy could equally well be used.  The first three arguments in the
slice_ call are the grid points in the x, y, and z
directions. The fourth argument is the scalar field defined on-top of
the grid. The next three arguments defines either slice planes in the
three space directions or a surface plane (currently not working). In
this example we have created 6 slice planes: Three at the x axis (at
x=-1.2, x=0.8, and x=2), one at the y axis (at y=2), and two
at the z axis (at z=-2 and z=0.0). The result is presented in
Figure fig:slice1.

FIGURE:[figs/slice1.eps] Slice plot where the x axis is sliced at -1.2, 0.8, and 2, the y axis is sliced at 2, and the z axis is sliced at -2 and 0.0 (VTK backend).


*Contours in Slice Planes.* With the contourslice command we can create contour plots
in planes aligned with the coordinate axes. Here is an example 
using 3D scalar field data from the flow function::

        x, y, z, v = flow()
        set(show=False)
        h = contourslice(x, y, z, v, seq(1,9), [], [0], linspace(-8,2,10))
        axis([0, 10, -3, 3, -3, 3])
        daspect([1, 1, 1])
        ax = gca()
        ax.set(fgcolor=(1,1,1), bgcolor=(0,0,0))
        box('on')
        view(3)
        set(show=True)
        show()

The first four arguments given to contourslice in this example are
the extended coordinates of the grid (x, y, z) and the 3D scalar
field values in the volume (v). The next three arguments defines the
slice planes in which we want to draw contour lines. In this
particular example we have specified two contour plots in the planes
x=1,2,\dots,9, none in y=const planes (empty
list) , and one contour plot in the plane z=0. The last argument to
contourslice is optional, it can be either an integer specifying the
number of contour lines (the default is five) or, as in the current
example, a list specifying the level curves. Running the set of
commands results in the plot shown in Figure fig:contourslice1.

FIGURE:[figs/contourslice1.eps] Contours in slice planes (VTK backend).

Here is another example where we draw contour slices from a
three-dimensional MRI data set::

        import scipy
        mri = scipy.io.loadmat('mri_matlab_v6.mat')
        D = mri['D']
        image_num = 8
        
        # Displaying a 2D Contour Slice:
        contourslice(D, [], [], image_num, daspect=[1,1,1])

The MRI data set is loaded from the file mri_matlab_v6.mat with the
aid from the loadmat function available in the io module in the
SciPy package. We then create a 2D contour slice plot with one slice
in the plane z=8. Figure fig:contourslice3 displays the result.

FIGURE:[figs/contourslice3.eps] Contour slice plot of a 3D MRI data set (VTK backend).


Visualization of vector fields
------------------------------

A vector field is a function from space or space-time to a vector
value, where the number of components in the vector corresponds to
the number of space dimensions. Primary examples on vector fields
are the gradient of a scalar field; or velocity, displacement, or
force in continuum physics.

In Easyviz, a vector field can be visualized either by a quiver
(arrow) plot or by various kinds of stream plots like stream lines,
stream ribbons, and stream tubes. Below we will look closer at each of
these visualization techniques.

Quiver Plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The quiver and quiver3 commands draw arrows to illustrate vector
values (length and direction) at discrete points.  As the names
indicate, quiver is for 2D vector fields in the plane and quiver3
plots vectors in 3D space.  The basic usage of the quiver command
goes as follows::

        x = y = linspace(-5, 5, 21)
        xv, yv = meshgrid(x, y, sparse=False)
        values = sin(sqrt(xv**2 + yv**2))
        uv, vv = gradient(values)
        quiver(xv, yv, uv, vv)

Our vector field in this example is simply the gradient of the scalar
field used to illustrate the commands for 2D scalar field plotting.
The gradient function computes the gradient using finite difference
approximations.  The result is a vector field with components uv and
vv in the x and y directions, respectively.  The grid points and
the vector components are passed as arguments to quiver, which in
turn produces the plot in Figure fig:quiver_ex1.

The arrows in a quiver plot are automatically scaled to fit within the
grid. If we want to control the length of the arrows, we can pass an
additional argument to scale the default lengths::

        scale = 2
        quiver(xv, yv, uv, vv, scale)

This value of scale will thus stretch the vectors to their double length. 
To turn off the automatic scaling, we can set the scale value to zero.

Quiver plots are often used in combination with other plotting
commands such as pseudocolor plots or contour plots, since this may
help to get a better perception of a given set of data. Here is an
example demonstrating this principle for a simple scalar field, where
we plot the field values as colors and add vectors to illustrate the
associated gradient field::

        xv, yv = meshgrid(seq(-5,5,0.1), seq(-5,5,0.1))
        values = sin(sqrt(xv**2 + yv**2))
        pcolor(xv, yv, values, shading='interp')
        
        # create a coarser grid for the gradient field:
        xv, yv = meshgrid(seq(-5,5,0.5), seq(-5,5,0.5))
        values = sin(sqrt(xv**2 + yv**2))
        uv, vv = gradient(values)
        hold('on')
        quiver(xv, yv, uv, vv, 'filled', 'k', axis=[-6,6,-6,6])
        figure(2)
        contour(xv, yv, values, 15) 
        hold('on')
        quiver(xv, yv, uv, vv, axis=[-6,6,-6,6]) 

The resulting plots can be seen in Figure fig:quiver_ex2 and
fig:quiver_ex3.

Visualization of 3D vector fields by arrows at grid points can be done
with the quiver3 command. At the time of this writing, only the VTK
backend supports 3D quiver plots. A simple example of plotting the
"radius vector field" v=(x,y,z) is given next::

        x = y = z = seq(-3,3,2)
        xv, yv, zv = meshgrid(x, y, z, sparse=False)
        uv = xv
        vv = yv
        wv = zv
        quiver3(xv, yv, zv, uv, vv, wv, 'filled', 'r',
                axis=[-7,7,-7,7,-7,7])

The strings 'filled' and 'r' are optional and makes the arrows
become filled 
and red, respectively. The resulting plot is presented in Figure 
fig:quiver3_ex1.

Stream Plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stream plots constitute an alternative to arrow plots for visualizing
vector fields.  The stream plot commands currently available in
Easyviz are streamline, streamtube, and streamribbon.  Stream
lines are lines aligned with the vector field, i.e., the vectors are
tangents to the streamlines. Stream tubes are similar, but now the
surfaces of thin tubes are aligned with the vectors.  Stream ribbons
are also similar: thin sheets are aligned with the vectors. The latter
type of visualization is also known as stream or flow sheets.  In the
near future, Matlab commands such as streamslice and
streamparticles might also be implemented.

We start with an example on how to use the streamline command. In
this example (and in the following examples) we will use the wind
data set that is included with Matlab. This data set represents air
currents over a region of North America and is suitable for testing
the different stream plot commands. The following commands will load
the wind data set and then draw some stream lines from it::

        import scipy  # need scipy to load binary .mat-files
        
        # load the wind data set and create variables:
        wind = scipy.io.loadmat('wind.mat')
        x = wind['x']
        y = wind['y']
        z = wind['z']
        u = wind['u']
        v = wind['v']
        w = wind['w']
        
        # create starting points for the stream lines:
        sx, sy, sz = meshgrid([80]*4, seq(20,50,10), seq(0,15,5), 
                              sparse=False)
          
        # draw stream lines:
        streamline(x, y, z, u, v, w, sx, sy, sz,
                   view=3, axis=[60,140,10,60,-5,20])

The wind data set is stored in a binary `.mat`-file called
wind.mat. To load the data in this file into Python, we can use the
loadmat function which is available through the io module in
SciPy. Using the loadmat function on the `wind.mat`-file returns a
Python dictionary (called wind in the current example) containing the NumPy
arrays x, y, z, u, v, and w. The arrays u, v, and w
are the 3D vector data, while the arrays x, y, and z defines the
(3D extended) coordinates for the associated grid. The data arrays in
the dictionary wind are then stored in seperate variables for easier
access later.

Before we call the streamline command we must set up some starting
point coordinates for the stream lines. In this example, we have used
the meshgrid command to define the starting points with the line::

        sx, sy, sz = meshgrid([80]*4, seq(20,50,10), seq(0,15,5))

This command defines starting points which all lie on x=80,
y=20,30,40,50, and z=0,5,10,15. We now have all the data we need
for calling the streamline command. The first six arguments to the
streamline command are the grid coordinates (x,y,z) and the 3D
vector data (u,v,w), while the next three arguments are the starting
points which we defined with the meshgrid command above. The
resulting plot is presented in Figure fig:streamline_ex1.

The next example demonstrates the streamtube command applied to the 
same wind data set::

        streamtube(x, y, z, u, v, w, sx, sy, sz,
                   daspect=[1,1,1],
        	   view=3,
        	   axis='tight',
        	   shading='interp')

The arrays sx, sy, and sz are the same as in the previous
example and defines the starting positions for the center lines of the
tubes. The resulting plot is presented in Figure
fig:streamtube_ex1.

FIGURE:[figs/streamtube_ex1.eps] Stream tubes (Vtk backend).

Finally, we illustrate the streamribbon command::

        streamribbon(x, y, z, u, v, w, sx, sy, sz,
                     ribbonwidth=5,
                     daspect=[1,1,1],
                     view=3,
                     axis='tight',
                     shading='interp')

Figure fig:streamribbon_ex1 shows the resulting stream ribbons.

Design
======

Main Objects
------------

All code that is common to all backends is gathered together in a file
called common.py. For each backend there is a separate file where
the backend dependent code is stored. For example, code that are
specific for the Gnuplot backend, are stored in a file called
gnuplot_.py and code specific for the VTK backend are stored in
vtk_.py (note the final underscore in the stem of the filename - all
backend files have this underscore). 

Each backend is a subclass of class BaseClass. The BaseClass code
is found in common.py and contains all common code for the backends.
Basically, a backend class extends BaseClass with
rendering capabilities and backend-specific functionality. 

The most important method that needs to be implemented in the backend
is the _replot method, which updates the backend and the plot after a
change in the data. Another important method for the backend class is
the hardcopy method, which stores an image of the data in the current
figure to a file.

Inspired by Matlab, the Easyviz interface is organized around figures and
axes. A figure contains an arbitrary number of axes, and the axes can
be placed in arbitrary positions in the figure window. Each figure appears
in a separate window on the screen. The current figure is accessed by
the gcf() call. Similarly, the current axes are accessed by calling
gca().

It is
natural to have one class for figures and one for axes. Class Figure
contains a dictionary with one (default) or more Axis objects in
addition to several properties such as figure width and height. Class Axis
has another dictionary with the plot data as well as lots of
parameters for colors, text fonts, labels on the axes, hidden surfaces, etc.
For example, when adding an
elevated surface to the current figure, this surface will be
appended to a list in the current Axis object. 
Optionally one can add the surface to another Axis
object by specifying the Axis instance as an argument. 


All the objects that are to be plotted in a figure such as curves,
surfaces, vectors, and so on, are stored in repsectively classes.  An
elevated surface, for instance, is represented as an instance of class
Surface.  All such classes are subclasses of
PlotProperties. Besides being the base class of all objects that can
be plotted in a figure
(Line, 
Surface, 
Contours, 
VelocityVectors, 
Streams, 
Volume), 
class PlotProperties also stores various properties that are common
to all objects in a figure. Examples include line properties, material
properties, storage arrays for x and y values for Line objects,
and x, y, and z values for 3D objects such as Volume.

The classes mentioned above, i.e., BaseClass with subclasses, class
PlotProperties with subclasses, as well as class Figure and class
Axis constitute the most important classes in the Easyviz interface.
Other less important classes are Camera, Light, Colorbar, and
MaterialProperties.

All the classes in common.py follows a convention where class parameters
are set by a setp method and read by a getp method. For
example, we can set the limits on the x axis by using the setp
method in a Axis instance::

        ax = gca()                  # get current axis
        ax.setp(xmin=-2, xmax=2)

To extract the values of these limits we can write::

        xmin = ax.getp('xmin')
        xmax = ax.getp('xmax')

Normal use will seldom involve setp and getp functions, since most
users will apply the Matlab-inspired interface and set, e.g., the
limits by::

        xlim([-2,2])
