_____Visualization of Scalar Fields_____

A scalar field is a function from space or space-time to a real value,
typically used to express the value of a scalar physical parameter
a every point in space (or in space and time). One example is temperature,
which is a scalar quantity defined everywhere in space and time.
In a visualization context, we work with discrete scalar fields that are
defined on a grid. Each point in the grid is then associated with a
scalar value.

There are several ways to visualize a scalar field in Easyviz. Both
two- and three-dimensional scalar fields are supported. In 2D we can
create elevated surface plots, contour plots, and pseudocolor plots,
while in 3D we can create isosurface plots, volumetric slice plots,
and contour slice plots.

___Elevated Surface Plots___

To create elevated surface plots
we can use either the `surf` or the `mesh` command. Both
commands have the same syntax, but the `mesh` command creates a
wireframe mesh while the `surf` command creates a solid colored
surface. We will first look at the `mesh` command.
