_____Easyviz Backends_____

Easyviz is a unified interface to other plotting packages, referred to
as backends. Several backends have been implemented to support various
plotting packages such as Gnuplot, Pyx, Pmw.Blt.Graph, Matplotlib,
Veusz, and VTK. Support for several other plotting packages are
planned in the future (including VisIt and OpenDX).

Because of limitations in many plotting packages, not all available
features in Easyviz are supported by every backend. For example, both
Gnuplot and VTK backends support visualization of 2D vector fields,
but Gnuplot does not support visualization of 3D vector fields, so
neither does the Gnuplot backend. The currently supported backends and
their corresponding requirements and limitations are described next.

__Gnuplot__. Gnuplot is a command-line driven interactive plotting
utility that works on most platforms. The software is freely
distributed and easy to install. Gnuplot supports many types of plots
in both 2D and 3D, including lines, contours, vector fields, and
surfaces. Curve plots and surface plots of 2D scalar fields can be
tuned to an excellent result, while 3D scalar and vector fields are
not supported.  To access Gnuplot from Python and send Numerical
Python arrays to Gnuplot, we use the Python module `Gnuplot`.

__PyX__. Description + state.

__Pmw.Blt.Graph.__ Pmw (Python Mega Widgets) extends the Tkinter
package with more sophisticated widgets, included an interactive
widget for curve plotting. This widget is based on the BLT package
(an extension of Tk written in C).

__Matplotlib__. Matplotlib is (at the time of this writing) quickly
gaining wide popularity in the scientific Python community.
The interface to Matplotlib is Matlab-insipired, and different
backends are used to create the plots (Gtk, Tk, ...?). Easyviz
applies the same ideas with a unified Matlab-like interface to various
backends, but Matplotlib is a much more comprehensive interface and
a very much larger package than Easyviz.

__VTK__. VTK (Visualization ToolKit) is a package primarily aimed at
visualizing 2D and 3D scalar and vector fields by a range of techniques.

__Veusz__.
