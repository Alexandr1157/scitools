; Default configuration file scitools.ini
;
; Items in this default file can be overrided by 
;   .scitools.ini in the directory where the Python program is started
;   .scitools.ini in the user's home directory

; Some variables in this file can also be overrided by environment
; variables. The name of the environment variable is the same as
; the variable names below, but with a prefix (SCITOOLS_ in this case).

[modes]
; Enable setting variables by environment variables with
; prefix_variablename, e.g., SCITOOLS_DEBUG
envir prefix = SCITOOLS_  

; Enable reading from command line through --variablename option, 
; e.g., --DEBUG
command line arguments = on  

[globals]
SAFECODE     = <bool> on    ; boolean: safety checks or not
OPTIMIZATION = <str>  off   ; 'F77', 'C', 'vectorization', 'on', etc.
VERBOSE      = <int>  3     ; an int for the level of verbosity
DEBUG        = <int>  1     ; debug level (0=off)
; python -O implies that DEBUG is set to 0

[scipy]
load = yes           ; true: from scipy import * (may have side effects)

[numpy]              
; Numerical Python is only loaded if scipy's load=no or scipy is not found
numpytools = yes     ; no: load numpy, yes: load numpytools

; Configuration of SciPy/NumPy: see documentation of scitools.basics
