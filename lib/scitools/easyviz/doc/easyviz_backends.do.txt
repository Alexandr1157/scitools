_____Easyviz Backends_____

As we have mentioned earlier, Easyviz is just a unified interface to
other plotting packages, which we refer to as backends. We have
currently implemented backends for Gnuplot, Grace, OpenDX, Matlab,
Matplotlib, Pmw.Blt, Veusz, VisIt, and VTK. Some are more early in
developement than others, like the backends for OpenDx and VisIt.

Because of limitations in many of the plotting packages, not all
features in Easyviz are supported by each of the backends. For
instance, Gnuplot and VTK both offer visualization of 2D vector
fields, however, Gnuplot has (at the time of this writing) no support
for visualization of 3D vector fields, so this is of course not
available in the Gnuplot backend either. 
 
We will in the following look closer at the backends that are
currently implemented in Easyviz and some of their corresponding
features, requirements, and limitations. We will also for each backend
look at a more advanced example where we grab the backend instance and
work directly on it.

__Gnuplot__. Gnuplot is a command-line driven interactive plotting
utility that works on most platforms. The software is freely
distributed and easy to install. Gnuplot supports many types of plots
in both 2D and 3D, including curve plots, contour plots, vector plots,
and surfaces. Curve plots and surface plots of 2D scalar fields can be
tuned to an excellent result, while 3D scalar and vector fields are
not supported. To access Gnuplot from Python and send NumPy
arrays to Gnuplot, we use the Python module `Gnuplot`. 

__Matlab__. 

__Matplotlib__. Matplotlib is (at the time of this writing) quickly
gaining wide popularity in the scientific Python community.
The interface to Matplotlib is Matlab-insipired, and different
backends are used to create the plots (Gtk, Tk, ...?). Easyviz
applies the same ideas with a unified Matlab-like interface to various
backends, but Matplotlib is a much more comprehensive interface and
a very much larger package than Easyviz.

__PyX__. PyX is a Python package for the creation of PostScript and
PDF files. It combines an abstraction of the PostScript drawing model
with a TeX/LaTeX interface. Complex tasks like 2d and 3d plots in
publication-ready quality are built out of these primitives.


__Pmw.Blt.Graph.__ Pmw (Python Mega Widgets) extends the Tkinter
package with more sophisticated widgets, included an interactive
widget for curve plotting. This widget is based on the BLT package
(an extension of Tk written in C).

The BLT backend offers currenlty only basic plotting functionality.

__Veusz__. 

__VTK__. VTK (Visualization ToolKit) is a package primarily aimed at
visualizing 2D and 3D scalar and vector fields by a range of techniques.
VTK is used to achieve 2D and 3D visualizations of the same type as 
Matlab offers.
