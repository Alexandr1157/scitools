=== The Plot Window Disappears Quickly ===

Add
!bc cod
raw_input('Press Enter: ')
!ec
at the end of the program. The plot window is killed when the program
terminates, and this satement postpones the termination until the user
hits the Enter key.

=== Check Your Backends! ===

When you encounter a problem with Easyviz plotting, make sure that the
backend works correctly on its own (there may, e.g., be installation
problems with the backend - Easyviz just calls the backend to do the
plotting). 

For the Gnuplot backend you can try the following commands in a
terminal window:
!bc rpy
Unix/DOS> gnuplot
gnuplot> plot sin(x)
!ec
This should result in a plot of the sine function on the screen.
If this command does not work, Easyviz will not work with the Gnuplot
backend. See the section *Installing Gnuplot* if you need help with 
installing the Gnuplot program and its Python interface.
