=== Check Your Backends! ===

When you encounter a problem with Easyviz plotting, make sure that the
backend works correctly on its own (there may, e.g., be installation
problems with the backend - Easyviz just calls the backend to do the
plotting). 

For the Gnuplot backend you can try the following commands in a
terminal window:
!bc
Unix/DOS> gnuplot
gnuplot> plot sin(x)
!ec
This should result in a plot of the sine function on the screen.
If this command does not work, Easyviz will not work with the Gnuplot
backend. See the section *Installing Gnuplot* if you need help with 
installing the Gnuplot program and its Python interface.
