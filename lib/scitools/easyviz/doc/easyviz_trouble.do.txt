=== Check Your Backends! ===

When you encounter a problem with Easyviz plotting, make sure that the
backend works correctly on its own (there may, e.g., be installation
problems with the backend - Easyviz just calls the backend to do the
plotting). 

For the Gnuplot backend you can try the following commands in a
terminal window:
!bc
Unix/DOS> gnuplot
gnuplot> plot sin(x)
!ec
This should result in a plot of the sine function on the screen.
If this command does not work, Easyviz will not work with the Gnuplot
backend. 

=== Installing the Gnuplot Software on Windows ===

 o Download the Gnuplot 4.2.4 binaries for Windows (or a newer version)
   A possible URL is
!bc
http://puzzle.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gnuplot/gp424win32.zip
!ec
   The zip file may have another name for a newer version of Gnuplot on
   Windows.

 o Unzip the `gp424win32.zip` file to the folder
!bc
C:\gnuplot
!ec

 o Add the folder name
!bc
C:\gnuplot\bin
!ec
   to the `PATH` environment variable (this is done in a graphical interface for
   setting environment variables).

 o Check out the latest SVN revision of the Python interface to
   Gnuplot, which is the Python module file `Gnuplot.py`:
!bc
svn co https://gnuplot-py.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnuplot-py/trunk/gnuplot-py
!ec

 o Install `Gnuplot.py`:
!bc
cd gnuplot-py
python setup.py bdist_wininst
dist\gnuplot-py-1.8+.win32.exe
!ec

 o Check out the latest SVN revision of SciTools:
!bc
svn co http://scitools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ scitools
!ec

 o Install SciTools:
!bc
cd scitools
python setup.py bdist_wininst
dist\SciTools-0.4.win32.exe
!ec
