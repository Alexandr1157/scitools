_______Tutorial_______

This tutorial starts with plotting a single curve with a simple
`plot(x,y)` command. Then we add a legend, axis labels, a title, etc.
Thereafter we show how multiple curves are plotted together. We also
explain how line styles and axis range can be controlled. The
next section deals with animations and making movie files. More advanced
topics such as fine tuning of plots (using plotting package-specific
commands) and working with Axis and Figure objects close the curve
plotting part of the tutorial.

Various methods for visualization of scalar fields in 2D and 3D are
treated next, before we show how 2D and 3D vector fields can be handled.
