Easyviz comes with the SciTools package, so to install Easyviz, you
just go to the `scitools` folder and run
!bc
Unix/DOS> python setup.py install
!ec
Easyviz is reached as the package `scitools.easyviz` and can be
imported in several ways (see the paragraph heading
"Importing Just Easyviz" in the Tutorial).

Easyviz will not work unless you have one or more plotting programs
correctly installed. Below, we have collected some information on installing
various programs. This information is in a very preliminary and incomplete
stage.

_____Installing Gnuplot_____

___Linux/Unix___

__Compile from Source.__
Gnuplot can be downloaded from gnuplot.sourceforge.net. It builds 
easily on most Unix systems. You also need the `Gnuplot` Python
module, which can be obtained from `gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net`.

__Debian/Ubuntu.__
Prebuilt versions are available for Debian/Ubuntu:
run
!bc
apt-get install gnuplot gnuplot-x11 python-gnuplot
!ec

___Windows___

On Windows, one can either use Gnuplot under Cygwin or use a precompiled
binary from sourgeforce.net.

__Using the Gnuplot Cygwin package.__ 
In this case there are two things that needs to be changed in the
`gp_cygwin.py` file in the top-level directory of the `Gnuplot.py`
source tree. First you need to change the `gnuplot_command` variable
to `gnuplot` instead of `pgnuplot.exe`. Then you should change the
`default_term` variable to `x11` instead of `windows` since the
Gnuplot Cygwin package is not compiled with the Windows
terminal. Finally, install `Gnuplot.py` (`python setup.py install`)
and launch X11 by running `startx` from a Cygwin prompt. Try to run
the `test.py` script that comes with `Gnuplot.py`. If everything
works, Easyviz can use Gnuplot.

__Using Gnuplot Binaries.__

 o Download the Gnuplot 4.2.4 binaries for Windows (or a newer version)
   A possible URL is
!bc
http://puzzle.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gnuplot/gp424win32.zip
!ec
   The zip file may have another name for a newer version of Gnuplot on
   Windows.

 o Unzip the `gp424win32.zip` file to the folder
!bc
C:\gnuplot
!ec

 o Add the folder name
!bc
C:\gnuplot\bin
!ec
   to the `PATH` environment variable (this is done in a graphical interface for
   setting environment variables).

 o Check out the latest SVN revision of the Python interface to
   Gnuplot, which is the Python module file `Gnuplot.py`:
!bc
svn co https://gnuplot-py.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnuplot-py/trunk/gnuplot-py
!ec

 o Install `Gnuplot.py`:
!bc
cd gnuplot-py
python setup.py bdist_wininst
dist\gnuplot-py-1.8+.win32.exe
!ec

 o Check out the latest SVN revision of SciTools:
!bc
svn co http://scitools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ scitools
!ec

 o Install SciTools:
!bc
cd scitools
python setup.py bdist_wininst
dist\SciTools-0.4.win32.exe
!ec


_____Installing Matplotlib_____

___Linux/Unix___

__Debian/Ubuntu.__
Prebuilt versions are available for Debian/Ubuntu:
run
!bc
apt-get install python-matplotlib dvipng
!ec

___Windows___
You can download prebuilt binaries from the Matplotlib home page.
